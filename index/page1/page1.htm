The Oakland Nature Preserve is located between Killarney Station and Downtown Oakland. This 128-acre preserve shows off the best of Florida's ecosystems, with a boardwalk 
giving a great view of Lake Apopka and the narby marshes, as well as a winding trail through the nearby woods. The boardwalk trail is a 2.1 mile loop with several rain
shelters along the way. The "Green Trail" (pictured below) is around the midway point, allowing for birdwatching and views of exotic animals such as peacocks, antelope, and emus in the nearby 
Briley Farms Wildlife Preserve. Also be sure to visit the Jim Thomas Educational Center, where you can purchase merchandise, see animals such as frogs, turtles, snakes, and bugs found
around the preserve, and learn about the local ecosystem from a preserve expert. Entry is completley <b>free</b>, so don't worry about an entry fee. It's a great place for a change of scenery 
from the bike trail; do note however, that bikes are not allowed on the trail itself, but places to lock your bike are readily available.

The goal of the Oakland Nature Preserve is to stop and reverse the damage done to Lake Apopka through its pollution. In the early 1920s it was used as a sewage dump by the city of Winter Garden, 
and in the 1940s many farmers started discharging nutrients into the lake. In 1992 the <b>Friends of Lake Apopka</b> was formed to halt the pollution, and the Oakland Nature Preserve was 
started in 1997 as a place for the restoration to establish themselves. As the lake and surrounding area healed, the preserve expanded their mission. On their website, their mission states:

"To promote an understanding of the fragile balance between mankind and the environment by <b>educating</b> visitors about
Lake Apopka basin's ecosystems and cultural history, and by <b>restoring</b> and <b>conserving</b> the lands within the Preserve."
