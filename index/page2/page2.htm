Winter Garden is called the "charming little city with a juicy past", and it certainly shows in its downtown. Once a citrus economy, like
the rest of Central Florida, development began in the 1960s as Central Florida quickly became an entertainment hub. Today, Winter Garden
is still growing thanks to its small-town charm and distance from major attractions like Disney and Universal Studios. The downtown is
primarily located on one stree - Plant Street - which the West Orange Trail cuts right through. Riders can stop for a bite to eat at
the many award-winning restaurants (see below) or browse the nearby stores, most notably the Plant Street Market, a large indoor market
(pictured below) home to the Crooked Can Brewing Company.

Winter Garden was incorporated as a city into Florida in 1925, but a lot of its history took place before its official founding. 
The first American settlers came in the 1850s and primarily grew sugar cane and vegetables, before citrus saw rapid growth in the 
late 19th century, which was then transported on the Orange Belt Railroad. While the Great Freeze of 1894-1895 severly damaged the 
citrus industry, remnants of it and the railroad that shipped the citrus can still be found, especially by taking a look at the 
<a href="https://www.cfrhs.org/">Central Florida Railroad Museum.</a> Also remaining from the past is the <a href="https://historicedgewater.com/">Edgewater Hotel</a>, a historic
Bed & Breakfast that first opened in 1927 to house the many fishermen who came for Lake Apopka, and the <a href="https://www.gardentheatre.org/">Garden Theatre</a>, 
first built in 1935 but today generates over $3 million annually from their musicals, dances, and movie showings.</p>
