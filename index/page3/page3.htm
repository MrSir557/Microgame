When biking from the Killarney end, at the end of your journey lies the pristine Wekiwa Springs National Park, where you can
experience swimming, kayaking, and fishing in the waters of the Wekiwa River, hiking along the trails that lead through woods and sandhill uplands,
and even camping overnight. The springs pump out an incredible 42 million gallons daily, and the water is always at 72 degrees F, perfect
for cooling down on a hot day.

The area was inhabited by Seminole natives, with "Wekiwa" translating to "spring of water" in the Creek language. The area became an attraction
in the 1860s, when it was called Clay Springs after the property owner. The property was bought by the Apopka Sportsman Club in 1941 for logging,
hunting, and fishing, and was again sold to the state of Florida in 1969, when it was made a state park. Wekiwa Springs is also home to the Florida Park
Service Ranger Academy, moved there from O'Leno State Park in 1977.
