<p align="center"><font size="4">The West Orange Trail is a 22.26 mile trail that borders the south and east shores of Lake Apopka.
<br />It is open from sunrise to sunset, and allows cyclists, hikers, and leashed pets, with equestrian trails accessible close by.
<br />With a trailhead at the Orange/Lake County border going all the way to the heart of Apopka, you'll be able to see dense forests, 
<br />bustling shopping centers, and picturesque suburb neighborhoods through the trail. The trail will soon become a part of the Florida
<br />Coast-to-Coast Connector Trail, a massive 250-mile trail that connects the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of Florida.</p>

<p align="center">The <b><font color="red">red</font></b> line shows the trail. The east end of the trail is located at <b>Killarney Station</b>, and the northwest 
<br />end is located at the intersection of <b>Rock Springs Rd.</b> and <b>Lester Rd.</b>, however you can continue safely biking north on 
<br />Rock Springs Rd. for about three miles. These ends, along with the <b><font color="green">green</font></b> markers, which show trailheads,
<br />are access points to easily enter and exit the trail, as well as stop to rest, use the restroom, or get a drink. The <b><font color="blue">blue</font></b> markers
<br />show historic sites, scenic views, and other areas of interest. Hover over each <b><font color="green">green</font></b> marker to find the name, address, and offered amenities 
<br />of each trailhead. Click on each <b><font color="blue">blue</font></b> marker to learn more information about these points of interest.</p>

<h1><p align="center">Staying Safe on the Trail</p></h1>
<p align="center">The West Orange Trail is a great way to get excercise, relax, and
<br />see some of Central Florida's natural wonders and small-town charm. However, if
<br />you plan to use the trail, make sure you stay safe for yourself and others. Below
<br />are trail rules, as well as tips to stay "trail smart".<p>

<h2><p align="center">West Orange Trail Rules</p></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Trails are open from dawn to dusk. You may not be on the trail when it is dark (after sunset/before sunrise).</li>
	<li>Helmets are required for all cyclists under 16, but are recommended for everyone.</li>
	<li>Pets must be controlled on a leash shorter than or equal to 6 feet. Owners must clean up after their pets.</li>
	<li>Alcoholic beverages are prohibited.</li>
	<li>Motorized vehicles are prohibited, excluding law enforcement, emergency responders, or maintenance vehicles. Electric mobility devices for mbility disabilities are permitted.</li>
	<li>Class 1 and 2 electric bikes are permitted, but Class 3 electronic bikes are prohibited.</li>
	<li>Speeds of over 20 miles per hour are prohibited.
</ul>

<h2><p align="center">Tips for Staying Trail Smart</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bring a phone so you can contact someone in an emergency.</li>

</img>
	<li>If you are in an emergency, look for the nearest yellow Emergency Response Marker on the trail to pinpoint your location to the emergency responder. (an example of these is provided on the right)</li>
	<li>Consider traveling with a friend; you'll have someone to help in an emergency, and it may make the experience more fun!</li>
	<li>Be aware of your surroundings and other people on the trail. Do not bike or skate recklessly.</li>
	<li>Plan out your route beforehand so you know how to effectively prepare.</li>
	<li>Depending on how long you plan to be on the trail, pack water, snacks, sunscreen, or other needed items. Florida weather for a large part of the year is in the 80s to 90s, so it can get very hot.</li>
	<li>Stay to the right of the trail at all times, except when passing someone ahead of you. Make sure to stay to the right if someone is attempting to pass you.</li>
	<li>If you are attempting to pass someone, make sure they know you are there, either with a verbal cue (i.e. "On your left!") or a bell.</li>
	<li>When observing wildlife on the trail, keep your distance and do not attempt to feed, approach, or pet any animals.
</ul>
